"""Additions to the network editor menu."""

This page describes the qLib menu items for the parameter RMB (right-click) menu.

NOTE:
    All provided items are marked with a `[qL]` label postfix
    to be easily identifiable. This can be useful in a production
    environment with potentially heavily customized menu sets.

The following is a list of all parameter menu items. Note that these are parameter
type sensitive, so only a subset of these is usually visible, depending on the
parameter type. (We include the corresponding types in each description.)
