"""Various color schemes and themes provided by qLib."""


== UI Color Schemes ==

qLib comes with a bunch of "complimentary" (as in, your mileage may vary) color schemes.
As you can imagine this is not a particularly cornerstone feature and
very ad-hoc maintained. Feel free to give it a try, though.

== Network Editor Color Theme ==

For the Network Editor, a "qLib" node color theme is provided. As opposed to
the UI color schemes, *we consider this theme very important* and it is actively
maintained.

Certain types of qLib nodes come with "default colors" (e.g. visualiser-type nodes
are blue, etc). These nodes used to set their color when they were created, but
we abandoned that in favour of our own node color scheme. This allows to create
your own variant of you don't like the colors we provide.
